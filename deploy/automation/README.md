### Alternative automation setup guide with Ansible:

1. Setup SSH keys for all devices:
```bash
# On your Ubuntu desktop
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "edge-compute"
# Copy to each device
ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.1.100
ssh-copy-id mendel@192.168.1.101
ssh-copy-id mendel@192.168.1.102
ssh-copy-id ubuntu@192.168.1.103
```

2. Install Ansible on your Ubuntu desktop:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```
3. Deploy to all devices:

```bash
cd deploy/automation
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```
4. Start developing:

```bash
# Clone on your development machine
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/edge-compute-platform.git
cd edge-compute-platform

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/initial-setup

# After making changes
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup"
git push origin feature/initial-setup
```
